A famous quote by Neeko Vozo:

>I once had a pet named Lucky that reminded me of home…and 
then it died…and then I ate it! 
And it was supremely delicious!

### Cooking Recipe
![](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/ginger-fried-rice.jpg?w=752)

__Ingredients__

* 1/2 cup peanut oil
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons minced ginger
* Salt
* 2 cups thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed and dried
* 4 cups day-old cooked rice; Vongerichten recommends 
* jasmine (I used brown jasmine) but this is the perfect way to use up any leftover rice you have, especially from Chinese delivery
* 4 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil (for some heat but the same awesome flavor, use hot sesame oil)
* 4 teaspoons soy sauce

__Tools__

* a nonstick skillet
* tablespoons 
* teaspoons
* a slotted spoon

__Steps__

1. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and brown.
2. Reduce heat under skillet to medium-low and add 2 tablespoons oil and leeks. Cook about 10 minutes,season lightly with salt.
3. Raise heat to medium and add rice.
4. In a nonstick skillet fry eggs in remaining oil, sunny-side-up, until edges are set but yolk is still runny.
5. Top each with an egg and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Sprinkle crisped garlic and ginger over everything and serve.

_There is no special season for the fried rice. And it is a traditional Chinese dish with many variations of recipe. For example, you can add your personally favorite ingredients._

##Euclidean Distance

#####Definition
_________________________________________
The __Euclidean distance__ between points __p__ and **q** is the length of the line segment concepting them ($\boldsymbol{\overline{pq}}$). In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if __p__ = ($p_{1}$, $p_{2}$,...,$p_{n}$) and __q__ = ($q_{1}$, $q_{2}$,..., $q_{n}$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from __p__ to __q__, or from __q__ to __p__ is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):
\begin{split}
d(\boldsymbol{p,q}) = d(\boldsymbol{q,p}) & = \sqrt{(q_{1}-p_{1})^2 + (q_{2}-p_{2})^2 +\cdots+ (q_{n}-p_{n})^2}\\  
                                          & = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}
\end{split}
The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, __p__ and __q__ may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (termianl points) ending at the two points. The [__Euclidean norm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or __Euclidean length__, or __magnitude__ of a vector measures the length of the vector.

  $$\|\boldsymbol{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \cdots +p_n^2} = \sqrt{\boldsymbol{p \cdot p}}$$,

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
