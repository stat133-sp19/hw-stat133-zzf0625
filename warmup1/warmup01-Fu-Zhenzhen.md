A famous quote by Neeko Vozo:

> I once had a pet named Lucky that reminded me of home…and then it died…and then I ate it! And it was supremely delicious!

![](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/ginger-fried-rice.jpg?w=752)

**Ingredients**

-   1/2 cup peanut oil
-   2 tablespoons minced garlic
-   2 tablespoons minced ginger
-   Salt
-   2 cups thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed and dried
-   4 cups day-old cooked rice; Vongerichten recommends
-   jasmine (I used brown jasmine) but this is the perfect way to use up any leftover rice you have, especially from Chinese delivery
-   4 large eggs
-   2 teaspoons sesame oil (for some heat but the same awesome flavor, use hot sesame oil)
-   4 teaspoons soy sauce

**Tools**

-   a nonstick skillet
-   tablespoons
-   teaspoons
-   a slotted spoon

**Steps**

1.  In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and brown.
2.  Reduce heat under skillet to medium-low and add 2 tablespoons oil and leeks. Cook about 10 minutes,season lightly with salt.
3.  Raise heat to medium and add rice.
4.  In a nonstick skillet fry eggs in remaining oil, sunny-side-up, until edges are set but yolk is still runny.
5.  Top each with an egg and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Sprinkle crisped garlic and ginger over everything and serve.

*There is no special season for the fried rice. And it is a traditional Chinese dish with many variations of recipe. For example, you can add your personally favorite ingredients.*

Euclidean Distance
------------------

##### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment concepting them ($\\boldsymbol{\\overline{pq}}$). In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,...,*p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):
The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (termianl points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$$\\|\\boldsymbol{p}\\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdots +p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{p \\cdot p}}$$
,

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
